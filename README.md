### Intro and our Second App ###

Hello again! Over the next two tutorials we will be building a To-Do list app. This will teach us about two main topics

1. Activities. Our last app only had one screen. As our apps get more complex we will want more screens (for example, the Facebook app has a newsfeed screen, a screen when you click on a post, a screen for notifications, etc.). These screens are called activities.
2. Saving data. We want our user's to-do items to be saved when they close the app. 

This lesson will cover activities and the next one will cover saving data.
